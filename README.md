## Description

This project is a simple day planer for your typical 9-5 workday. It will Highlight times of day (past,present and future) based off of the current time. The program will also allow you to save the information you entered to local storage, this way you can close the page and refresh and the information will stay in its palce.
This is all green because it is midnight so everything is future from midnight which is 0
