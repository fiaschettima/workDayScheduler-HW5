## Code Snippets
![Code Ex](./assets/images/codeSnippet.png)

This section of code is listenting for user input anywhere on the container that holds the quiz buttons. Then checks if what you clicked is a button and if it is then increase score, update score on the HTML, removes the question you were on and then generates the next question.

## Usage 

Test your knowledge or make your own quiz questions to change the difficulty up.

## Technology Used
    -JavaScript
    -HTML
    -CSS

## Learning Points
    This project offered a chance to learn and gain a better understanding of JS functions and event listeners as well as using local storage.
---
## Problems faced
During the project my only issue I was un able to resolve was pulling the highscores and show new unique scores for each attempt.
I do believe I did what was required but it's not in a real applicable state for use outside of this assignment.
